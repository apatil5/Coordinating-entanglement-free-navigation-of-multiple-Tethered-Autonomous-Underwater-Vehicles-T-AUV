This work presents an algorithm for optimizing operational strategies for heterogeneous mobile robot systems in real-world tasks like deliveries, surveillance, and search and rescue. The focus is on solving a min–max multiple depot heterogeneous asymmetric traveling salesperson problem (MDHATSP). Using a primal–dual approach, the algorithm finds efficient tours for multiple robots from different depots, ensuring all targets are visited while minimizing the latest task completion time. The algorithm, capable of addressing generalized asymmetric cost problems, aims for near-optimal solutions with low computational demands. Simulation tests confirm its effectiveness for real-time applications.
