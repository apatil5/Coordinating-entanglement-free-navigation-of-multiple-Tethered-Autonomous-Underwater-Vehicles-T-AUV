This work introduces heuristics to coordinate multiple Tethered-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (T-AUVs), which can operate longer underwater due to continuous power and communication via the tether. The main challenge is preventing tether entanglement and collisions. The coordination problem involves three sub-problems: 
1) task allocation (assigning tasks and determining the optimal sequence), 
2) path planning (finding the best path for the given sequence), and
3) scheduling (managing arrival and departure times to avoid collisions).

Solving these 3 sub problems simultaneously for large problems is complex and computationally demanding. Our initial research developed a primal-dual, multi-layer heuristic to address these challenges.

Building on that, we propose an iterative heuristic that allocates tasks while proactively preventing entanglements. Simulations with varying problem sizes show the algorithm's effectiveness and real-time potential, offering reliable solutions efficiently. This research advances underwater robotics with practical applications for T-AUV systems.
