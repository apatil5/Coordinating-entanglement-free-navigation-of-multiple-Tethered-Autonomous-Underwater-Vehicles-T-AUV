This work introduces heuristics to coordinate multiple Tethered-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (T-AUVs). Tethered AUVs can operate longer underwater due to continuous power and communication via the tether. However, the challenge is to cordinate the operation avoiding tether entanglement or collison. Cordination problem of T-AUVs is comprised of 3 sub problems:
Task allocation: assigning the tasks to the vehicles and finding an optimal sequence of visit
Path planning: finding an optimal path with a given sequence of tasks
Scheduling: determining arrival and departure times on the given routes to avoid collision

Soving the three probelm simultatneously is a complex and computationally challengeing. To solve this problem our initial research developed a Primal Dual based multiple layer heuristic for task assignment, path planning and reordering to address the entanglement issue.

Building on that, we propose an iterative heuristic that allocates tasks while proactively preventing entanglements. Simulations with varying problem sizes show the algorithm's effectiveness and real-time potential, offering reliable solutions efficiently. This research advances underwater robotics with practical applications for T-AUV systems.
